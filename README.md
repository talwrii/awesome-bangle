## About me
I am **@readwithai**. I create tools for reading, research and agency sometimes using the markdown editor [Obsidian](https://readwithai.substack.com/p/what-exactly-is-obsidian).

I also create a [stream of tools](https://readwithai.substack.com/p/my-productivity-tools) that are related to carrying out my work.

I write about lots of things - including tools like this - on [X](https://x.com/readwithai).
My [blog](https://readwithai.substack.com/) is more about reading and research and agency.
